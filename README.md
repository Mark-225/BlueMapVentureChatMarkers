This Paper plugin adds VentureChat markers to [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/Bluemap). It is a fork of [BlueMapChatMarkers](https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapChatMarkers) with the only changes being added support for VentureChat events and a few more config options necessary for this new integration (see default [config.yml](src/main/resources/config.yml) under "VentureChat" for a detailed description).

Compatible with Paper 1.13+, just like BlueMap itself.

You can customise the style of the markers with the `textStyle.css` file in the config directory.\
To reload it, just reload BlueMap itself with `/bluemap reload`.
